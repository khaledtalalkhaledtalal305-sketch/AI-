    <h1>Welcome to the World of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence represents one of the most transformative technologies 
        in modern human history. It combines mathematics, computer science, statistics, 
        cognitive science, and engineering to create intelligent systems capable of 
        performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These systems can 
        analyze massive datasets, recognize complex patterns, learn from experience, 
        and continuously improve their performance without being explicitly programmed 
        for every scenario.

    <h2>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on 
        building machines and software that can simulate human cognitive functions such 
        as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. 
        AI systems rely heavily on data, algorithms, and computational power to make 
        predictions and decisions. Over the past decade, rapid advancements in processing 
        capabilities and the availability of big data have accelerated AI development 
        dramatically.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are multiple subfields within AI, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, 
        Natural Language Processing, Robotics, and Computer Vision. Each of these areas 
        focuses on different aspects of intelligence. For example, Machine Learning enables 
        systems to learn from historical data and improve automatically, while Natural 
        Language Processing allows machines to understand and generate human language. 
        Together, these technologies power virtual assistants, recommendation systems, 
        autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostic tools, and advanced security systems.

            <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data 
                without being explicitly programmed. Algorithms analyze patterns within 
                datasets and make predictions or decisions based on statistical models. 
                It is widely used in fraud detection, recommendation engines, predictive 
                analytics, and financial forecasting.

            <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Deep Learning is an advanced branch of Machine Learning that uses artificial 
                neural networks inspired by the human brain. These networks process massive 
                amounts of structured and unstructured data, making them ideal for image 
                recognition, speech processing, language translation, and autonomous systems.

        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
            <p>
                Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual 
                information from the world, such as images and videos. It is applied in 
                facial recognition, medical imaging analysis, self-driving cars, and 
                industrial automation systems.

    <h2>Real-World Applications of AI</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is already deeply integrated into everyday life and 
        business operations across industries. In healthcare, AI assists doctors by 
        analyzing medical images, predicting disease risks, and personalizing treatment 
        plans. In finance, AI detects fraudulent transactions, automates trading strategies, 
        and improves risk assessment models. In transportation, AI powers autonomous 
        vehicles and traffic optimization systems that reduce congestion and improve safety.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, AI enhances customer experiences through chatbots, personalized 
        recommendations, voice assistants, and smart home devices. Businesses leverage 
        AI-driven analytics to gain insights from customer behavior, optimize supply chains, 
        and improve operational efficiency. Governments use AI for cybersecurity, 
        infrastructure management, and public safety monitoring.
